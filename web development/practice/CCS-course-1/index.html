        <p>Drive My Car (Japanese: ドライブ・マイ・カー, Hepburn: Doraibu Mai Kā) is a 2021 Japanese drama film[3] co-written and directed by Ryusuke Hamaguchi dealing with the grief and loss of a middle-aged theater director following the premature death of his wife.[4] It is based on Haruki Murakami's short story of the same name from his 2014 collection Men Without Women, while taking inspiration from other stories in it.[5] The film follows Yūsuke Kafuku (played by Hidetoshi Nishijima) as he directs a multilingual production of Uncle Vanya in Hiroshima and grapples with the death of his wife, Oto.

            Drive My Car had its world premiere at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival, where it competed for the Palme d'Or and won three awards, including Best Screenplay. The film received widespread critical acclaim, with many declaring it one of the best films of 2021.[6][7][8] It earned four nominations at the 94th Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay, winning Best International Feature Film.[9][10] It is the first Japanese film nominated for Best Picture.[11] At the 79th Golden Globe Awards, the film won Best Foreign Language Film. It became the first non-English-language film to win Best Picture from all three major U.S. critics groups (the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, the New York Film Critics Circle, and the National Society of Film Critics).</p>
